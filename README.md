## Purpose and What Is? 
I developed this project to play around with the famous Statistics Law of Large Numbers. In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.

## Principal 
After each trial, we obtain an $\overline{X}$ and from the simulation as we increase the number of trials, that sample mean ( $\overline{X}$ ) converges closer and closer to the theoretitcal mean ( $\mu$ ). Thus, <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\overline{X}_n \to \mu \quad\textrm{as}\ n \to \infty \ \textrm{where, } \overline{X}_n=\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\sum X_i$
